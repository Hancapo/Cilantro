## Overview
Cilantro Asset Importer is a Chrome extension that allows users to import 3D assets directly from the [Pleb Masters: Forge](https://forge.plebmasters.de) website into Blender.  

This extension operates entirely within the user's browser environment and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information.

---

## Data Collection
This extension **does not collect**, **store**, or **share** any kind of personal data.  
All functionality runs locally in the user's browser. No network requests are made to external servers other than the Pleb Masters: Forge website, which the user is already visiting.

---

## Permissions
The extension requests the following permissions:

- **`scripting`** – used to inject a small script that adds a “Send to Blender” button on supported pages.  
- **`webNavigation`** – used to detect when the user navigates to a new asset page on Pleb Masters: Forge.  
- **`https://forge.plebmasters.de/*`** – required to access and modify pages on the Forge website where the import button is displayed.

These permissions are used **solely** to enable the core functionality of the extension and are never used for tracking or analytics.

---

## Third Parties
No information is shared with third parties.  
The extension does not use any external analytics tools, tracking scripts, or remote code.

---

## Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact the developer through the Chrome Web Store listing page.
